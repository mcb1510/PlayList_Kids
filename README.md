# Playlist Kids App

Playlist Kids is a dual Flutter app system designed for safe, parent-controlled media consumption. It includes a Parent App and a Kids App that communicate through Firebase. Parents filter and select content (videos, games, and e-books) for their children to access. Kids interact only with that selected content.
